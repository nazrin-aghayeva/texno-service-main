                            <p><span>PROQRAMLAŞDIRMA</span>Security in IT protects all digital information and IT assets from both external and internal accidental and malicious threats. A business can implement all sorts of cyber security measures, but if its employees don’t get training to avoid cyber traps, cyber-attacks are just a few clicks away. Our team helps organizations identify risk areas and how malicious attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to infrastructures. Employees receive training using social engineering risks-assessments and tests that simulate real-life events and mimic attacks. Our team provides online and onsite training and can customize programs based on individual needs and requirements. IT faces intense pressure to address the threats while also meeting compliance requirements. Taking on the challenge to ensure security and protect information requires investments in advanced technologies. IT must also allocate multiple resources to manage several critical tasks: Detecting changes in network traffic that signal an attack Monitoring individual devices to detect unusual activity Remediating potential security issues Providing detailed reports on security performance to key stakeholders and regulatory bodies.</p>
